if you checkout my repository, you should have everything you need. No need to download other libraries etc. 

You have 
- /inc directory (with header files)
- /lib has prebuilt binaries 

static linking - the library gets put into your executable 
dynamic library - the library gets loaded on the fly at runtime

static linking is technically faster.
